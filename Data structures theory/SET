ðŸ”¹ What is a Set?
A set stores only unique elements

It stores elements in sorted order automatically (ascending)

It does not allow duplicates

//SYNTAX
#include <set>
set<int> s;

//OPERATIONS IN A SET

insertion- s.insert(10);
delete- s.erase(10);
search- s.find(10)!=s.end();
size-s.size();
print- using loop for(auto x:s)

//UNORDERED SET
same as set but not sorted

//SYNTAX
#include <unordered_set>
unordered_set<int> us;

s.end() - iska matlab hota hai ki not found (we have reached the end but the element is not present,it is generally used with the find)
